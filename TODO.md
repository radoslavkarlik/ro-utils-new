better min level decision - figure out the very earliest level - e.g. 23.25 % instead of 24
fix batching so its not split because of overlevel, calculate min level for doing batch
save reason why certain step was made - eg prevent overleveling, reach next target monster, etc
logic tests
refactor
code quality
better global flags handling - rates etc
choose correctly dataset baseexp, jobexp
choose monsters from db
quests from db?
functions for base and job separately cause often it uses explicitely one param as 0 and uses only result for one param

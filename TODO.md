5 decayed nails

test journey from a fixed point.. e.g. for checking progress and overlevel from that one

add batch quest warning

binary tree search for level based on exp? other optimizations
allow split of batched quests - just consider them as separate quests

save reason why certain step was made - eg prevent overleveling, reach next target monster, etc
logic tests
refactor
code quality
better global flags handling - rates etc
choose correctly dataset baseexp, jobexp
choose monsters from db
quests from db?
functions for base and job separately cause often it uses explicitely one param as 0 and uses only result for one param

exp point - class associated get raw, get level
